<P><STRONG>Safe Participation in the Community</STRONG></P>
<P><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">While VirusTotal has commercial relationships 
with select members of the Community (organizations, institutions and Partners) 
public access to the VirusTotal Site is only available free of charge. 
</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">VirusTotal offers certain functionality that 
may require the creation of a personal account (e.g. to participate in the 
VirusTotal Community). Depending on the information provided in the registration 
and profile building process, your account may uniquely identify you. Any 
comment, post or other activity you engage in with the Community when using your 
account will generate content attributed to you 
(“</SPAN><STRONG>Content</STRONG><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">”).</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">To the extent you use any 
password/keys/credentials to access the Service, you are exclusively responsible 
for generating unique and complex credentials, safeguarding them, and for any 
activities or actions taken on the Service using such credentials. </SPAN></P>
<P id="sample-community-content-guidelines"><STRONG>Sample &amp; Community 
Content Guidelines</STRONG></P>
<P><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">To the extent you elect to contribute any 
Sample to the Community, you confirm that all content contained in the Sample 
complies with these Terms and our </SPAN><A href="https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002168385-Privacy-Policy"><SPAN 
style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Policy</SPAN></A><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">, 
that you are either the original owner of the Sample you submit or that you have 
the necessary rights and permissions to irrevocably contribute the Sample and 
share it, and information about it, with the Community. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">You understand that if you submitting any 
Sample, the Sample is immediately shared for review by the Service’s Partners, 
and the resulting intelligence report is shared with you and, and with the 
Partners, which use the results to improve their own systems. As such, by 
contributing a Sample, you are contributing to the effort to raise global IT 
security levels.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">While you retain any ownership rights in the 
original material contained in the Sample, when you upload or otherwise submit a 
copy of the Sample, you give VirusTotal (and those we work with) a worldwide, 
royalty free, irrevocable and transferable licence to use, edit, host, store, 
reproduce, modify, create derivative works, communicate, publish, publicly 
perform, publicly display and distribute all content </SPAN><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">contained</SPAN><SPAN 
style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Sample.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT YOU WILL ONLY UPLOAD 
SAMPLES THAT YOU WISH TO PUBLICLY SHARE AND THAT IN ANY CASE, YOU WILL NOT 
KNOWINGLY SUBMIT ANY SAMPLE TO THE SERVICE THAT CONTAINS CONFIDENTIAL OR 
COMMERCIALLY SENSITIVE DATA OR PERSONAL DATA OF ANY INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT LAWFUL 
PERMISSION.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">Although we have no obligation to monitor use 
of the Service, user Content or any Samples, we may monitor the Service to 
detect and prevent fraudulent activity or violations of these Terms and retain 
absolute discretion to remove Samples, Content or users from the Service at any 
time and for any reason without notice. At the same time, to promote the 
security of the Community and information sharing accountability, accounts and 
Samples contributed by the Community (for example, comments, posts, etc.) 
generally will not be removed from the Service, unless they are illegal, violate 
the lawful rights of an individual, serve any other unethical/malicious purpose, 
or otherwise violate these Terms. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO PUBLICLY SHARE A SAMPLE 
IN THE MANNER SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR IN THE&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002168385-Privacy-Policy"><SPAN 
style="font-weight: 400;">PRIVACY POLICY</SPAN></A><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">, 
DO NOT SEND IT/CONTRIBUTE IT TO THE SERVICE AS THE SERVICE IS DESIGNED TO WORK 
THROUGH THE COLLECTIVE AGGREGATION AND SHARING OF THREAT-INTELLIGENCE WITH AND 
THROUGH THE COMMUNITY.</SPAN></P>

and at our sole discretion. Nothing in our Terms gives you a right to use the

<P><STRONG>Changes in Service</STRONG></P>
<P><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">The Service provided by VirusTotal is 
constantly evolving, and the form and nature of the Service that VirusTotal 
provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. Any changes 
to the Service, including the release of new VirusTotal features, are subject to 
the Terms then in effect. In addition, VirusTotal may stop (permanently or 
temporarily) providing the Service (or any features within the Service) without
